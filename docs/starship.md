# Starship Prompt

As a shell prompt I use starship which gives nice context in my shell environment like git branch, kubernetes context.

There are a few notable configurations that I have

- Kubernetes Context on second line: Keeps context easily visible helpful when switching between many clusers.
- Disable cloud environment labels: AWS, Azure, and GCP environment in prompt. Not very useful in my usecases and usually just create clutter.
